    <h1>Brian Voter</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my site! I'm a developer based in NY, and a soon-to-be student at Rithm School.</p>
      <h2 id="aboutSection">About</h2>
      <p>I've been developing software for several years, with applications including game server plugins, robotics,
        programs facilitating research on air quality and fake twitter accounts, and more.
      </p>

      <p>I graduated in 2019 with a bachelors in computer science from Cornell University, and then spent a few
        years doing intensive language studies, particularly in Chinese, which included a nine month stay in Taiwan
        on a scholarship from the Taiwanese government.
      </p>

      <p>Outside of being a veritable language learning addict, I can usually be found reading or
        trying to perfect the latest recipe I've discovered.
      </p>

      <p>These days I'm branching out into web development and looking to start my career as a software engineer by
        attending Rithm School.
      </p>
